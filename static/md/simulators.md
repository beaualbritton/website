# hardware simulators

suite of hardware simulators i developed to deepen my understanding of computer architecture, systems programming and sofware/hardware interaction.

#### cache simulator (c++)
  - set-associative simulator in c++ with lru eviction, write-back/through policies and configurable cache size

#### risc-v instruction pipeline (c & python)
  - 3-stage risc pipeline simulator in both languages, compares accuracy and runtime performance

#### branch predictor (c++ & python)
  - configurable n-bit branch predictor in c++ analyzing dynamic branch prediction accuracy across any instruction trace
